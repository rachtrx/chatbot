There are a few initiatives we have been strengthening and working on as we move towards our vision of ‘A Vibrant School Community where Education is Transformed’. I look forward to sharing these with you at our first Parent-Teacher Conference on 3rd February.   As per previous years, this monthly letter contains pertinent information that we hope will be useful in navigating the school year. I encourage you to take the time to read through the information provided in these letters.  My staff and I look forward to your continued partnership in our desire to have our students ‘rooted in values, prepared for life, and empowered to make a difference’.  FOR YOUR ACTION 1) Sale of Uniform in School The school uniform supplier (Jeep Sing Fashion) will be selling the school uniform in front of the school bookshop: Date  Time Venue Note When out-of-stock occurs, the uniform vendor will contact parents directly for collection when the stock arrives.

      "|None|None|None|None|Financial Assistance Scheme.|None|\fREF: 2023/PRI/01/01  6 January 2023 Dear Parents/Guardians, Welcome to the start of another new school year!  2023 looks to be an exciting one as we resume many programmes and activities that had to be halted or modified due to COVID. There are a few initiatives we have been strengthening and working on as we move towards our vision of ‘A Vibrant School Community where Education is Transformed’. I look forward to sharing these with you at our first Parent-Teacher Conference on 3rd February.   As per previous years, this monthly letter contains pertinent information that we hope will be useful in navigating the school year. I encourage you to take the time to read through the information provided in these letters.  My staff and I look forward to your continued partnership in our desire to have our students ‘rooted in values, prepared for life, and empowered to make a difference’.  FOR YOUR ACTION 1) Sale of Uniform in School The school uniform supplier (Jeep Sing Fashion) will be selling the school uniform in front of the school bookshop: Date  Time Venue Note When out-of-stock occurs, the uniform vendor will contact parents directly for collection when the stock arrives. The School will not issue the uniforms to your child, including students on the Financial Assistance Scheme. Monday, 9 January 2023 10.30 a.m. – 12.15 p.m. & 12.45 p.m. – 1.30 p.m. In front of the school bookshop As part of school safety and security, caregivers entering the school will need to register with the security officer at the school main entrance.  2) Temperature-Taking Exercise The school will be conducting a temperature-taking exercise on Wednesday, 11 January 2023, as part of the Safe Management Measures. All students MUST bring their digital thermometer to school on that day. Students may purchase the digital thermometer at $3.50 and/or a battery at $0.20 at the General Office/school bookshop.  3) 2023 Book List  The 2023 Book List will be issued on Monday, 9 Jaunuary. The class teacher will indicate on the list the required learning materials to be purchased for your child/ward. Please pay the exact amount for the materials to your child/ward’s class teacher by Friday, 13 January. \fGrace Orchard School 恩园学校 Shaping Special Lives for Significance 170 West Coast Road, Singapore 127443. www.go.edu.sg  F: 6561 4133 PRI-1 T: 6561 9128     4) School Fees Schedule 2023 The 1st quarter school fees (Jan to March) will be scheduled between 13 and 17 March 2023. You are strongly encouraged to pay your child’s school fees via GIRO/Edusave (please note that a portion of the school fees of $6.50 cannot be deducted from Edusave and will have to be paid via GIRO or in cash).

The class teacher will also share the Education Goals (EG) for the class and how parents can support their child's learning in school. There will also be parent workshops available for parents to attend according to your interests and needs.  There will be no school for all students and they will undertake Home-Based Learning (HBL) on 3 February. HBL materials will be provided by the teachers.
